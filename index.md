# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hi! I'm **Puneeth Rao**, a final-year **Business with Information Systems** student at **Dublin Business School (DBS)**.  
I’m passionate about **data analytics**, **business intelligence**, and **data visualization**, and I enjoy transforming raw data into insights that support smarter business decisions.

This portfolio is a collection of my academic projects, analytical work, and creative dashboards. It represents my learning journey in understanding how technology, analytics, and business come together to create value and efficiency in organizations.

## Featured Projects

Explore my [Projects](projects) page to see examples of what I’ve worked on, including:

- **Power BI dashboards** that visualize key business trends and performance metrics  
- **Data analysis projects** using **Excel, SQL, and Python** to uncover insights from datasets  
- **Interactive visualizations** that tell stories through data  
- **Business process studies** focusing on how information systems support strategic goals  

Each project has helped me develop skills in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling — as well as how to interpret analytics in a real-world business context.

## About Me

Throughout my studies at DBS, I’ve developed a strong interest in how data can drive growth and innovation.  
I’m particularly focused on areas like **data-driven decision-making**, **business reporting**, and **digital transformation**.  

My coursework and projects have allowed me to gain practical experience in tools such as **Power BI**, **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Python**, and I’m continuously learning to improve my technical and analytical skills.

I’m enthusiastic about opportunities where I can apply my knowledge to real-world challenges — whether through internships, collaborative projects, or analytics roles — and continue growing as a data professional.
